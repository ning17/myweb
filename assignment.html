  <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items for your Website Assesment</b></h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements. Do not name this
    page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your
    assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Please, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
    <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it
    </li>
    <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
      delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
      mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
      differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
      better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
      look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
      might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
      it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
      it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
      style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
      assignment tasks.</li>
    <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
    <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
  </ul>

  <h1><b>Website Release 2.0</b></h1>
  <h2><b>2.1 Call to Actions</b></h2>
  <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/index.html">https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/index.html</a></p>
  <p>CTA-1 is using the most interesting contents to attract users to click and encourage users to explore more funny stuffs; <br>
    CTA-2 is calling users to subscribe my website and it will forward to feedback page</p>
  <h2><b>2.2 Photo Gallery</b></h2>
  <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/drinks.html">https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/drinks.html</a></p>
  <p>click icon to see my comments on every .png file; use an image overlay title on hover </p>
  <h2><b>2.3 &amp; 2.4 Storyboard + Video / Javascript</b></h2>
  <h2><b>2.3  Javascript addition</b></h2>
  <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/script.js">https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/script.js</a></p>
  <ul>
    <li>1. Menu, I want to highlight the current page with black and the rest with lightblack dynamically, so it is implemented by javascript.</li>
    <li>2. Home page, I added four social media buttons on the header menu and I also want them to be on the footer description to encourage users share on their social media. But I don't want to create all these buttons twice, so I use javascripts to replicate them when loading this page</li>
    <li>3. Home page, I want to know how people find this website so that I could design some promotions on these effective channel. Thus, I create a float window for survey on the right-down. And after filling in survey, a pop-up window will show my thanks to users.</li>
    <li>4. About page, user can click every photo to know more details about me and click again to go back to these photos. So I use javascript to make a flipping card effect</li>
    <li>5. Drink page, use can see descriptions about every drink if they click camera icon. But it is different from flipping card effect, it is consisted by a series of modals where users can click "prev" and "next" for a better viewing. And of course, they can close modal to go back to drink page.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><b> Well written Javascript</b></h2>
  <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/script.js">https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/script.js</a></p>

  <h1><b>Website Release 3.0</b></h1>
  <h2><b>3.1 Reflections</b></h2>
  <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/aboutsite.html">https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/aboutsite.html</a></p>
  <h2><b>3.2 Alternative CSS</b></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>new css file - style_sidebar.css: <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/style_sidebar.css">https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/style_sidebar.css</a></li>
    <li>mainly affected html - <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/index.html">https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/index.html</a></a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Notes:<br>
    When user click the sidebar button ä¸‰ on the leftmost side of the header, they can see a sidebar navigation layout for the website page, and it has been applied in every page.<br>
    The original css file is used while some contents are overwritten by new css file so that they are changed to fit the sidebar layout.<br>
    Compared the old and new page, apart from the sidebar, it also has a hover effect on the menu items of the new page. What's more, every module was surrounded by a border to make it more clear.<br>
    And the CTA 1 component has a totally different design to attract users' attention. Instead of using two seperate columns, new page uses the same background image to construct CTA -1. <br>
    Thus, font colors and components positions were adjusted to fit the new layout.
  </p>
  <h2><b>3.3 Social Networking Button(s) or Feed(s)</b></h2>
  <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108">https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108</a></p>
  <p>Notes: every webstie has the social media buttons in the header and footer, so that users can share my website through creating a new post on their website.<br>
    In the footer section, I added an interesting facebook feed(page button) for those coffee lovers.</p>
  <h2><b>3.4 Website Accesibility</b></h2>
  <p>Notes: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>All media has a descriptive alternative text -- used 'alt' to describe images </li>
    <li>Proper Headings structure is used -- organised their sequences, refer to "General - Font" part in style.css </li>
    <li>icon sizes are at least 45 x 45 pixels -- social media buttons are icons which were resized to 45 x 45 pixels, but I didn't resize emoji used in pages because they belong to text.</li>  
    <li>All site elements are accessible using the tab key on your keyboard -- checked</li> 
    <li>All href links have an aria-label associated with them -- used 'aria-label' for all href</li> 
    <li>Abbreviations in content have an abbr tag associated with them -- used 'abbr' for abbreviations to further explain.<br>
       For example, in the <a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/aboutme.html">About Me</a> page, abbreviations were used to explain ML, NLP, SOE.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><b>3.5 Website Validation</b></h2>
  <p><a href="https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/validation.html">https://stuweb.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u7444108/validation.html</a></p>
  <p>Notes: <br>
    There are three modules for 'HTML','TOOL_HTML' and 'CSS' in this page, please click for details. <br>
  For HTML, added screenshots.<br>For CSS, added url instead of screenshots because it supports an interoperable Web page</p>
  <h2><b>3.6 Something Original</b></h2>

  </ul>
  <p>Notes:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Storyboard: Create a storyboard to show the idea of this website, and the painting was drawn by the myself.<br></li>
    <li>Extesnsion Page: this is a page listing links to sites I have found useful while developing my website.</li>
    <li>HTML Page:<br>
      1. Create a webpage for validation results, and it is a good way to show the validation results to users. <br>
      2. Extract header and footer sections from original page as these parts are used for every page, then use javascript to include them when loading page. More detials please refer to below introduction of JS functions. <br>
    </li>
    <li>JS functions: <br>
    Apart from js functions used for the pages newly created for assignment 3, I rewrote the js functions for the header and footer sections for a better reusing resources and it is easier for developers to recontruct these parts.<br>
