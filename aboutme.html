                <p class="small-p margin-left-20"> Let me tell you a story about CaffeiNing.<br><br>
                    It all started a decade ago in Shanghai with a simple cup of pour-over coffee made from Ethiopia
                    Yega
                    <abbr title="Single Origin Espresso">SOE</abbr>, washed processed. From that moment on, my
                    fascination with coffee blossomed into a full-blown
                    passion. I have since embarked on a journey to explore the rich tapestry of flavors and aromas that
                    coffee has to offer.<br><br>
                    Venturing into various cafes has become a beloved pastime, where I immerse myself in their signature
                    brews and engagingin enlightening conversations with talented baristas. Through these activities, I
                    have
                    leaned invaluable insights and knowledge about the artistry behind each cup.<br><br>
                    Driven by a thirst for understanding, I have delved deep into the intricacies of coffee. From
                    learning
                    about its diverse origins and varieties to mastering sensory evaluation and cupping techniques, I
                    have
                    eagerly absorbed every aspect of this beloved beverage. My curiosity also led me to explore
                    different brewing
                    methods and the regular coffee drinks.<br><br>
                    At first, I shied away from documenting my coffee adventures, believing that true appreciation
                    should be
                    experienced with all the senses. However, as my journey progressed, I came to realize the importance
                    of
                    preserving these moments and insights. Thus, coffeining was born - a space to not only record down
                    my
                    experiences but also to share my passion and ideas with other coffee enthusiasts.
