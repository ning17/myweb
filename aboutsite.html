                            <p><i>When I first started designing my website, I didn't have a clear overall plan, which
                                    became
                                    evident
                                    as I progressed from Assignment 1 to Assignment 3. Hereâ€™s what I learned from
                                    iterating my
                                    design
                                    through the different versions:</i></p>
                        </div>
                        <p><b>Reusable Module: </b>In the early stages, I didn't fully consider module reusability,
                            especially the CSS. I focused only
                            on the components I was developing without considering their impact on other pages. To
                            address this,
                            I redesigned the CSS structure, separating common styles from page-specific ones, making the
                            site
                            easier to maintain.</p>
                        <p><b>Friction Conversion: </b>Calls-to-Action (CTA) initially lacked appeal and visibility.
                            After feedback from Assignment 2
                            grading and peer reviews, I I changed the background of CTA buttons "Explore more" from
                            transparent to white with opacity of 0.8 to make it more clearer and
                            more attractive. I also optimized confusing labels. For instance, the previously
                            non-clickable "What
                            are you looking for" field was made clickable and editable, providing visitors with a more
                            direct
                            way to interact with the site.</p>
                        <p><b>Accessibility: </b>Initially, I neglected the needs of people with disabilities, such as
                            not including alternative text
                            and having insufficient contrast. I added alternative text to images and ensured all href
                            links have
                            associated aria-labels. Additionally, abbreviations now include abbr tags, and I improved
                            the visual
                            contrast to ensure clear page structure. These changes have made the site more accessible to
                            a
                            broader audience.</p>
                        <div class="leftbar">
                            <p><i>Due to time constraints, there are still some tasks that remain unfinished. I plan to
                                    address these in future iterations:</i></p>
                        </div>
                        <p><b>Responsive Design: </b>Initially, my website was designed only for my Chrome browser
                            without considering other devices,
                            screen widths, or resolutions. I redesigned the layout to ensure proper display across
                            different
                            devices, improving the website's responsiveness. However, I plan to continue refining this
                            aspect.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Unfinished Content: </b>Time constraints led me to comment out some features. The Beans
                            module, for instance, was initially
                            left incomplete. My plan is to divide this module into three sub-pages: Varieties,
                            Processes, and
                            Sensory, providing a comprehensive exploration of each aspect.</p>
